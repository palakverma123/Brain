Summary

This Python script integrates a **FAST API backend** with a **Streamlit frontend** to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading brain MRI images and obtaining segmentation results for metastasis detection. The solution leverages a machine learning model, implemented using PyTorch, to process images and generate segmentation masks.

### Key Components

1. **Model Definition**:
   - A simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model (`MetastasisSegmentationModel`) is defined for the segmentation task. The model can be modified to fit a more complex architecture based on specific requirements.

2. **Model Loading and Prediction**:
   - The `load_model` function initializes the model and loads pre-trained weights (if available).
   - The `predict` function preprocesses the uploaded images, runs them through the model, and returns the segmentation results.

3. **FAST API Server**:
   - The FastAPI server is created to handle image uploads via the `/predict/` endpoint. When an image is uploaded, it processes the image and returns a segmentation mask in JSON format.
   - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware is enabled to allow communication between the Streamlit app and the FastAPI server.

4. **Streamlit User Interface**:
   - The Streamlit UI allows users to upload MRI images in various formats (JPEG, PNG). The uploaded images are displayed on the interface.
   - Upon submission, the image is sent to the FastAPI backend for processing, and the resulting segmentation mask is visualized using Matplotlib.

5. **Running the Application**:
   - The script starts the FastAPI server in a separate thread while simultaneously running the Streamlit UI in the main thread, providing an interactive experience.

### Instructions to Use
1. **Install Required Packages**: Use a `requirements.txt` file to install necessary libraries such as FastAPI, Streamlit, PyTorch, and Matplotlib.
   
2. **Execute the Script**: Run the script using Python to launch the application, which starts the FastAPI server and the Streamlit frontend.

### Conc
This integrated application enables users to easily upload brain MRI images and obtain segmentation results, facilitating the detection of metastasis with the aid of a machine learning model. The solution exemplifies the use of modern web frameworks to create
